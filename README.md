## Problem Statement

AtliQ Media is a private media company and they wanted to telecast a show on Lok Sabha elections 2024 in India.
Unlike other channels they do not want to have a debate on who is going to win this election.
They rather wanted to present insights from 2014 and 2019 elections without any bias and discuss less explored themes like voter turnout percentage in India.

## Learnt things from this Project

**1**) Learn about election term in depth.

**3**)Tried using color palette and stick with that colors throughout the dashboard.

## Some Important insights from the Dashboard

**âš«**If we combine the seats from the top 5 states, they account for more than 50% of the total seats.

**âš«**Female representation was not even 15% in 2019; it was 14.36%, and it was 11.55% in 2014.

**âš«**The BJP is far ahead of the other top 5 parties.

**âš«**The voter turnout ratio is maximum in northeast part of country and minimum in jammu & kashmir.

**âš«**There is positive but weak relation between voter turnout ratio and postal vote% ,literacy , per capita income but has negactive relation with GDP.

**âš«**Exit polls are only correct 20.88% of the time, which is too low to trust.
